# GroceryMart

Just like your shop has shelves and products, your website will have pages:
















🏠 Home Page — your shop name, opening hours, welcome message and  USPs

📷 Products Page — list of vegetables, fruits, prices (with images)

📞 Contact Page — your phone number, WhatsApp button, location map

📣 Offer Page (optional) — “Get ₹50 off on first order!” Combos, flash deals


Order Info – Steps, zones, timings

Testimonials – Quotes, ratings

Ordering, Payment & Checkout
Enable online orders for pickup or local delivery, and support both UPI and cash payments. The checkout must be fast and secure.
