<!-- i will use aws because A food delivery app is hosted on AWS servers — it handles storage, users, and runs 24/7 globally.
 docker is used to containerize the application, making it easy to deploy and scale.
 docker is better than aws because it allows for easy deployment and scaling of applications, making it more efficient for managing resources.
