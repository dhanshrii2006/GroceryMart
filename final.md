Based on your answers—full control, \~100 SKUs, weekly/manual updates, cloud-hosted (Docker/AWS/Netlify), login, real-time stock alerts, direct UPI checkout, and on-site smart recommendations—here’s a modern, battle-tested tech stack outline:

---

## 1. Frontend

**Framework:**

* **Next.js (React)**

  * SSR/SSG for SEO (fast product pages).
  * File-based routing for catalog, product, login, admin.
  * Built-in API routes if you need lightweight endpoints.

**Styling/UI:**

* **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
* **shadcn/ui** components + **lucide-react** icons for polished cards, forms, modals.

**Key Features:**

* **Login/Signup** via NextAuth.js (supports JWT, OAuth).
* **Real-time stock badge:** use React state + WebSocket to gray‐out or “Out of stock” badge on product cards.

---

## 2. Backend

**Option A: Node.js with NestJS**

* Modular, decorators, TypeScript—great for domain logic (products, orders, users).
* Built-in WebSockets module for stock notifications.
* Easy integration of UPI-collect APIs (e.g. Razorpay’s UPI collect) in a payments module.

**Option B: Python with Django + DRF**

* Batteries included: admin UI to manage products, users, orders.
* Django Channels for real-time notifications.
* REST API consumed by Next.js frontend.

> Both options pair well with TypeScript on the front end—choose NestJS for full-TS uniformity, or Django if you prefer Python’s ergonomics.

## 3. Database & Search

* **PostgreSQL** for relational data (products, users, orders, stock).
* **Redis** (optional) for caching product lookups and pub/sub stock updates.
* **Elasticsearch** or **Meilisearch** for lightning-fast full-text search and filters (categories, price, brand).

---

## 4. AI & Smart Recommendations

* **Product descriptions & metadata:** integrate OpenAI’s GPT-4 API to auto-generate or refine descriptions when adding new products.
* **Recommendation engine:**

  1. **Collect events** (views, adds-to-cart, purchases) in your backend.
  2. Use an open-source library like **RecBole** (Python) or **Mahout** (Java) to train a simple collaborative-filtering model.
  3. Expose a “/recommendations” endpoint that Next.js calls on the product page (“Customers also viewed/bought”).

---

## 5. Payments (Direct UPI)

* **Razorpay UPI Collect API**

  * Generate a UPI collect link/QR for each order.
  * Customer pays in their UPI app; Razorpay webhooks your backend when payment succeeds.
* **Fallback “Cash on Pickup”** option handled directly in checkout form.

---

## 6. Hosting & Deployment

* **Frontend:**

  * **Vercel** (native Next.js support) or **Netlify**
  * CI/CD via GitHub Actions—automatic deploy on push to `main`.
* **Backend + DB:**

  * Containerize with **Docker** → deploy to **AWS ECS Fargate** (serverless containers) or **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.
  * **AWS RDS** for PostgreSQL + **Elasticache Redis**.
* **Infrastructure as Code:**

  * **Terraform** or **AWS CDK** to version-control your infra.

---

## 7. DevOps & Monitoring

* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions pipeline to build, test (unit + integration), and deploy both frontend and backend.
* **Logging & Alerts:**

  * **AWS CloudWatch** or **Datadog** for log aggregation and alerts (e.g. low-stock thresholds).
* **Error Tracking:**

  * **Sentry** for frontend and backend exceptions.

### Next Steps

1. **Scaffold** your Next.js repo (with Tailwind + NextAuth).
2. **Spin up** a NestJS (or Django) backend with Docker.
3. **Design** your PostgreSQL schema: products, categories, users, orders, stock\_history.
4. **Integrate** UPI collect and webhook flow.
5. **Add** Meilisearch for product search/filter.
6. **Wire up** WebSocket stock notifications.
7. **Build** your AI-powered description/recommendation scripts.
